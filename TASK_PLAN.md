# TASK_PLAN — Open Pixel Gun 3D Backend

Status keys: `[ ]` pending · `[/]` in progress · `[x]` completed

## Phase 0 — Analysis (done)

- [x] Confirm the client's main-server transport is **HTTP**, not WebSocket
      (`BestHTTP`/`UnityWebRequest`; the WebSocket code in the build belongs to
      the Photon peer and PGCompany analytics).
- [x] Inventory the retired hosts the 23.1.3 client talks to:
      `server-v2.pixelgun3dserver.com/auth_v2/`, `secure.pixelgun3dserver.com`
      (configs, ABTests, BuffSettings, rating/map configs),
      `pixelgun-clientlogs-{eu,us}.lightmap.com/problem`,
      `player-prefs.lightmap.com`, `geoip.lightmap.com`,
      `events-stat-{1,2}.lightmap.com`, `acct.pixelgun3dserver.com/events`,
      `secure.pixelgunserver.com/invite_service`, `cfg.pixelgun3d.com/config.json`.
- [x] Decide the split: server owns state and policy; the APK keeps only
      "where is my server" plus the transport shim.

## Phase 1 — Server core (done)

- [x] Go module, GPLv3, `.gitignore` excluding player data and secrets.
- [x] `internal/config`: environment-only configuration, no committed secrets.
- [x] `internal/logs`: one-line key=value events; verbatim body capture with
      hex fallback; dated log file plus stdout.
- [x] `internal/store`: accounts, rotating sessions, bans (player/device/IP,
      with expiry), atomic persistence.
- [x] `internal/secrets`: AES-256-GCM envelope, player-bound AAD, key derivation.
- [x] `internal/api`: v1 routes, legacy `/auth_v2/` `/time` `/problem` bridge,
      `/@host/...` prefix stripping, admin endpoints behind a bearer token,
      `http.unhandled` logging for uncovered routes.
- [x] `internal/discovery`: UDP LAN responder (`OPG3D-DISCOVER-V1`).
- [x] `cmd/opg3d-backend`: graceful start/stop, boot diagnostics.
- [x] Tests: registration/session rotation, sealed AppID + AAD binding,
      ban enforcement, admin gate, rewritten legacy path, update availability,
      store persistence and ban expiry.

## Phase 2 — Endpoint coverage driven by real logs

- [ ] Capture one full boot-to-battle session of the client pointed at this
      server; collect every `http.unhandled` line.
- [ ] Implement remote configuration delivery (the `pixelgun3d-config/*` family)
      from server-side JSON documents.
- [ ] Player profile / progression persistence server-side (replaces the
      client-side `Storager` trust model).
- [ ] Clans, mailbox, leaderboards, friends/invites.
- [ ] Decide per endpoint: implement, stub with a logged 200, or refuse.

## Phase 3 — Client-side surgery (repo: OLD-PIXEL-GUN-3D-ONLINE-PROJECT, branch 23.1.3)

- [ ] Remove the in-process C++ backend: `backend_emu_http.h`,
      `backend_emu_routes.h`, `backend_emu_store.h`, `backend_emu_2313.h`,
      `backend_local_2313.h`, `backend_local_1610.h`, `identity_2313.h`.
- [ ] Remove the retired-service compensation layers that the real server makes
      unnecessary (`online_state_2313.h`, `net_stall_guard_2313.h`,
      `cloud_guard.h`, `cheat_guard.h`, progression/pixel-pass/hidden-items and
      the rest of the local content grants), keeping the APK signature patch.
- [ ] Add the server selection screen: LAN scan or manual host/domain entry,
      persisted; all user-facing text through the localization files.
- [ ] Add the thin transport shim: rewrite retired hosts to the selected server,
      attach player id and session, decrypt the AppID envelope.
- [ ] Take the update check and download URL away from the client and read them
      from `/api/v1/update`.
- [ ] Client-side traffic log: request, response, and the value the client
      expected when a parse or state transition fails.

## Phase 4 — Operations

- [ ] `deploy/`: systemd unit and container file.
- [ ] Optional TLS / reverse-proxy notes for the VPS case.
- [ ] Admin CLI or minimal web panel for accounts and bans.
- [ ] CI: `go vet`, `go test`, cross-compiled release binaries.
- [ ] Decide whether live events need a WebSocket channel; add it only if a
      real use case appears.
